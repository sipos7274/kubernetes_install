This script intended to install kubernetes control-plane and worker-plane as well on ubuntu or debian systems.
I tested this script on Debian 12.

You need to run this script on every system that involved in the cluster (control and worker plane as well)
The script gonna install everything for you, after it's done gonna ask what kind of machine you runned the script worker or control plane.
